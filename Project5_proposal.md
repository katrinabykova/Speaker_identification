**Introduction**

​	The ability to identify a person by his/her voice has a number of applications from unlocking a digital device or car, customer identification, recognition of a specific user and applying user specific preferences to forensic authentication.

**Goal**

​	Develop a system for speaker voice recognition.

**MVP**

​	Minimum Viable Product is a CNN that can classify human speech recordings based on the speaker identity. 

**Data**

[*LibriSpeech*]( http://www.openslr.org/12from) from OpenSLR. Corpus (1000 hours) of read English speech.

*VoxCeleb* -  dataset of human speech, alternative data set.

**Conclusions**

​	Speaker identification systems have multiple applications. As a result, models developed for the speaker identification will also vary depending on the specific need they will be used for.
